Similar to Yelp using FourSquare API

Search Bar has 
  -Keywords: (Default should show trending/recommended places)
  -Location: They can type in a location (or pick a location - might implement)

Google Maps shows the requested venues in that location.
Expanding individual venues should show more information from API
such as Menu, Events, Links, Photos, Hours etc.

Once user searches, Call will be made to express API endpoint to retrieve venues.
Once the venues are received, pin them on the map in some orderly manner. (possibly sound)
  -Pinning on the map will be based on Lat and Long coords

If user hovers over a pin, basic information should display such as the
name of the place, category icon, address, website maybe
